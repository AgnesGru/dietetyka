## DB for nutritionists
This is a project that I created to improve my skills in the field of Databases and T-SQL language.
The database is designed for nutritionists who run a private dietary clinic.
Currently, the project contains sql files in which the BD is created, completed and the following clauses are executed on it:
* pivot, 
* unpivot, 
* group by, 
* having,
* join,
* over,
* where,
* analytic functins
Analytic functions can be used only in Select and order by  clauses because the are working on wirtual table. 
The order of clauses:
 - where
 - group by
 - having
 - analytic functins
 - order by
 - limit
